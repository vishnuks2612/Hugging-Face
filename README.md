# Hugging-Face



This html website is an image classifier
It works with a simple html webpage and a hugging face api
In the UI, we can see the herading 'hugging face', then two fields one is 'select an image' an d other one is 'file upload field'.
Usr can upload an image to find the species.


The html website correctly work in Google Chrome.
In the html form there is only two fiels were added, one is image upload field and the next  one is a text field
In the script, I added the url to the hugging face api
And fetch the details from the api using POST method and the help of token authorization field, that is already made in the hugging face 
Here I call the API and the token from the hugging face website.


The external source I used to make this html website is YouTube.
I referres many youtube videos to make this simple website, and I adopted many suggestions and concept from them.
Not one perfectly work, But in my code almost all the breed I tried is get correct output.
